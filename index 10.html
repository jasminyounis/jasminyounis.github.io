<p> You were able to get a room at the Four seasons by the Nile river, within city limits.</p>
<p> This will allow you to explore what the locals do, but give you space to head farther out, even if it means hitting traffic.</p>
<p> Anyway, I'll let you get some rest and enjoy the rest of the trip!</p>
<p> Salam.</p>
