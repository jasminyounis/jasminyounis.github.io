  <p> With the final project, I was looking around at some selfies I had glitched for another project. Having this desire to continue learning about animation, I wanted to tell a story with on the glitched portraits. 
  I found this one portrait that looked like my head was split open. By using Photoshop, I added illustrations in layer comps, then I put the images into Autodesk Sketchbook to create a gif. I believe we all have this feeling sometimes, especially during the times of shelter-in-place, there is this overwhelming feeling to the point where you feel yourself overthinking and your head is throbbing. 
   To me, this gif focuses on the feeling of being overwhelmed and just wanting to release the negative energy to have a fresh start.</p>
